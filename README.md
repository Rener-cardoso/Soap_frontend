This application serves as a virtual phonebook, where the user enters the name and phone number they want to save and can check it whenever they want.
To create this application, I used Next.js for the frontend, implementing input validations with Zod and always keeping the code as intuitive as possible to facilitate future maintenance.
I created the entire server part using Node.js and the Prisma query builder, which has a very easy-to-use syntax, making the process of creating tables much more productive.
